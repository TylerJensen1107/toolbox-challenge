	<p>The objective is to match all the tiles. There are 8 pairs of tiles. Once one tile is clicked, you can click any other tile that has not already been matched.
	After clicking two tiles, they will stay face up for a moment, so you can remember where they are. The game is over when you match all 8 pairs.</p>
